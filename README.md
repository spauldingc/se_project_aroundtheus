**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones. 

This project has been optimized for screen sizes between 320px width and a standard desktop computer size.

This project displays several sites around the U.S. that may be of interest to the viewer. The design was developed in Figma (see link below) and the project can be viewed in github (see link below).
